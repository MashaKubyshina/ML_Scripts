This project is a compilation of exercises done during GDG Cloud Edmonton ML Bootcamp in summer 2021.
The bootcamp explored data pipelines, word2vec, NER, Transformers and Bert ML models.
Tutorials were created by the mentors.
The excercises were created by our mentors and completed by us individually.
